# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-10-10

- Site: interactive plan page (`site/plan.html`) showing inputs, processing and outputs per milestone.
- `docs/ecosystem.md`: survey of free software relevant to testing, crash consistency,
  kernel data structures, BFS tooling and agent memory layers.
- ADR-0005: agent memory model (typed attributes, kernel-side attribute indexes,
  ioctl queries) with the Be File System as design reference; no code changes.
- Clarified LLM memory/context as the project goal in both READMEs and the site,
  separating future agent workflows from the implemented read-only M1.
- Native Linux read-only filesystem module, offline image creator and verifier.
- Independent file inodes can share one immutable payload; FIEMAP exposes sharing.
- Versioned M1 disk format with bounded parsing, CRC32C metadata and SHA-256 content.
- Tool tests and isolated QEMU mount tests, including malformed images and read-only enforcement.
- Project history, architecture decisions and shared Codex, Claude and Cursor rules.
- GPL-2.0-only license for the entire project.
- English/Portuguese README, contribution, governance, security and conduct policies.
- Issue/PR templates, pinned CI actions and a static GitHub Pages site with a reproduction guide.

This is an experimental milestone, not a stable release or the complete transactional MVP.
